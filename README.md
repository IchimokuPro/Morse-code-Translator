# Morse-code-Translator
here's a simple Morse code translator in Python

This code defines a dictionary morse_code_dict containing the mapping of characters to Morse code. It then defines two functions text_to_morse and morse_to_text for translating text to Morse code and vice versa. 

In the main part, it takes user input and determines whether it's text or Morse code, then translates accordingly.
